# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

# ðŸš€ Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and classify rice leaf diseases, 
enabling early detection and intervention to improve crop yield. The model achieves high accuracy and is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals.

# âœ¨ Features

Image-Based Detection: Classifies rice leaf diseases based on leaf images.
Accuracy: Robust predictions across different disease types.
Comprehensive Workflow: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset comprises images of rice leaves categorized into major disease types, such as:

* Brown Spot
* Bacterial Blight
* Leaf smut

# Usage

Training the Model
Place the dataset in the appropriate folder (e.g., data/).
Open and run the Jupyter notebook file (RiceLeaf - Rice Leaf Disease using CNN.ipynb) in Jupyter or Colab.
Testing the Model
Use the trained model to classify test images or visualize predictions.

# ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements

Add more disease categories to the dataset.
Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-world use.
Experiment with advanced architectures like EfficientNet for better performance.
